QUICK SETUP (One Time):

1. Make script executable:
   chmod +x convert

2. Use it:
   ./convert "Page 1.idml"

OPTIONAL - Run from anywhere:

If you want to run it from any folder without typing the full path:

1. Add to PATH (add this line to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Desktop/indesign"

2. Then you can run from anywhere:
   convert "Page 1.idml"

Or create an alias (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   alias convert-idml="$HOME/Desktop/indesign/convert"

Then use:
   convert-idml "Page 1.idml"
